1-D FFT Nerual Network benchamrk
------------------------------------

-C-Implementations of typical FFT Algorithms and the nerual network approach:

-Run a simple make in the directory to compile the benchmark. 

-The nerual network has trained using 100k samples. Feed frowarding are implemented (matrices multiplication).
  Folder "weights" contain all wights learned from training

You only need to look at/modify/run benchmark.c 

Benchmark: compares the speed of each implementation for 1000 times of computations of randomly generated time-domain
	    signal with length 32.
